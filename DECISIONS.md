## ADR-0001: World scale and chunk grid derived from 2D kingdom bounding box

**Date:** 2026-07-29

**Decision:** The 3D open world's extent is derived from the 2D map's `INIT_KINGDOMS` coordinates
in `script.js`, not an arbitrary size. `#map-canvas` (`style.css`) is a 9000x7000px space; the 14
kingdom seats in `INIT_KINGDOMS` span x:[920,6190], y:[300,5370] within it. We pad that box by 800
map-units per side (so seats near the edge, e.g. Night King at y=300 and Xaro Xhoan Daxos at
x=6190, aren't at the literal world edge) and clamp to the canvas bounds, giving a working area of
x:[120,6990], y:[0,6170] — 6870 x 6170 map units.

We scale at **10 meters per map unit**, giving a world of **68.7km x 61.7km (~4239 km² by exact
bounds, ~4278 km² once rounded up to whole 500m chunks)**. Chunk size is **500m x 500m**, giving a
**138 x 124 chunk grid (17,112 chunks total)**. These are recorded as `WORLD_SCALE` and
`CHUNK_CONFIG` in `src/3d/config.js`.

**Reasoning:**
- The project's explicit goal is a Westeros-continent-scale open world covering every kingdom
  location on the existing 2D map, not a small permanent tech-demo valley. Deriving the world size
  from real kingdom data (instead of picking a round number) is the only way to guarantee every
  kingdom fits, and gives a concrete, falsifiable "World Coverage %" metric to track.
- 10 m/map-unit sits in the middle of the suggested 5-15 m/unit range: fine enough that kingdoms
  keep sensible relative spacing (e.g. the two closest Tyrell seats, Berk and Ziya, are 90 map units
  apart -> 900m apart in-world, a plausible short ride), while large enough that the full map
  resolves to a "several dozen km per side" continent rather than a city-sized area.
  15 m/unit would inflate the world by 50% for no added benefit at this stage; 5 m/unit would
  compress the two Riverlands-area seats to within a few hundred meters of each other, which reads
  as one settlement instead of two lords' seats.
- 500m chunks match the streaming distance already named in this project's guidelines ("500m
  unload/preload streaming"), keep the grid a manageable 17,112-entry array of plain descriptor
  objects (not meshes — nothing is generated until a chunk is actually requested), and are coarse
  enough that a chunk's LOD0 terrain patch is still cheap to generate procedurally on demand.
- Only kingdom **seats** (the 14 `INIT_KINGDOMS` entries with `house`/`title`) were used for the
  bounding box, not the ~150 decorative `_fig` marker entries (army icons, dragon illustrations)
  also present in `script.js`. Those are 2D-map set-dressing, not settlement locations Phase 3 will
  place castles at, and including them would have pulled the box north to y=40 for no gameplay
  reason (dragon/army decorations cluster near the top of the 2D map purely for layout, not lore).

**Alternatives considered:**
- *Fixed round-number world size (e.g. a flat 10km x 10km square).* Rejected: doesn't guarantee
  kingdom coverage, and contradicts the explicit "must eventually cover every kingdom" requirement.
- *1:1 map-unit-to-meter scale.* Rejected: would make the world only ~6km x 6km, i.e. barely above
  the stated 8km x 8km minimum and clearly not continent-scale.
- *Smaller (100-250m) chunks for finer streaming granularity.* Rejected for now: at this world size
  that's 60,000-425,000 grid entries — still cheap as plain objects, but adds bookkeeping complexity
  Phase 1 doesn't need yet. Can be revisited (would require a config bump + regenerating any already
  -built chunk terrain) once real per-chunk generation cost is measured.

**Consequence:** `World Coverage %` (tracked in `3D_GAME_PROGRESS.md`) is now a concrete, computable
ratio: sum of already-generated chunk areas / 4278 km². Nothing has been generated yet, so it starts
at 0%. Every future terrain/chunk-generation task should move this number, and Phase 3/10 cannot be
marked DONE below 80% per the project's phase-gate rules. If `INIT_KINGDOMS` coordinates change
materially in a future 2D-game update, this ADR's bounding box (and the `WORLD_SCALE` constants in
`config.js`) must be recomputed rather than left stale.

## ADR-0002: separate "Phase 1 preview" chunk radius from the real streaming radius

**Date:** 2026-07-29

**Decision:** `CHUNK_CONFIG` now has two radius constants instead of one:
`STREAM_RADIUS_CHUNKS` (unchanged, still `2`) and a new `PHASE1_PREVIEW_RADIUS_CHUNKS` (`6`).
`game3d.js`'s one-time boot-time `chunkManager.loadSquare(...)` call now uses the new constant;
`STREAM_RADIUS_CHUNKS` is reserved for the future player-follow streaming system.

**Reasoning:** `STREAM_RADIUS_CHUNKS` was originally scaffolded in Phase 0/ADR-0001 as "the radius
kept loaded around the player" — a number that has to respect the **mobile** performance budget
(drawCalls<500, triangles<500K) at all times, since real gameplay on a phone keeps this many chunks
resident continuously. Reusing that same constant to size the Phase-1 no-player dev/preview load
(this run wanted to grow World Coverage, which pushed the loaded area from 25 to 169 chunks —
comfortably inside the **desktop** budget at ~1.38M triangles / 169 draw calls, but roughly 2.8x
over the mobile triangle budget) would have silently turned "mobile streaming radius" into "desktop
preview radius," corrupting a number Phase 10's `QUALITY_PRESETS` will later depend on for real
device tuning. Splitting them now costs one extra constant and keeps both honest: preview radius
can grow aggressively for World Coverage/desktop testing, streaming radius stays whatever the
mobile budget can actually afford, and neither has to be renegotiated when the other changes.

**Alternatives considered:**
- *Just raise `STREAM_RADIUS_CHUNKS` to 6.* Rejected: would make the documented "kept loaded
  around the player" number a mobile-budget violation the moment `game3d.js` treats it as gospel
  for a real streaming implementation later, unless someone remembers to lower it again first —
  exactly the kind of stale-config foot-gun this file exists to prevent.
- *Compute the preview radius from current screen/quality settings instead of a fixed constant.*
  Rejected as premature: there is no quality-detection system yet (that's Phase 10), and no player
  camera to size a "how far can you see" heuristic around; a fixed number is honest about what
  actually exists right now.

**Consequence:** `game3d.js`'s boot preview and any future real streaming implementation can now
be tuned independently. World Coverage jumped from 6.25 km² (25 chunks) to 42.25 km² (169 chunks,
~0.99%) in the run this ADR was written for, purely by raising the new preview constant — confirm
via a fresh desktop-budget check (drawCalls/triangles) whenever it's raised again, and never let
`STREAM_RADIUS_CHUNKS` itself grow past what the mobile budget in `config.js`'s `QUALITY_PRESETS`
comments can afford.

## ADR-0003: additive-only chunk streaming; World Coverage tracks cumulative, not resident, chunks

**Date:** 2026-07-29

**Decision:** `ChunkManager.streamTowards(centerChunkX, centerChunkZ, radius)` loads whatever's
newly in range of a moving center (the `OrbitControls` target, wired up in `game3d.js`), but does
**not** unload chunks that fall out of range. A separate `everGenerated` `Set` (only ever grows,
independent of the `loaded` `Map`, which eviction could shrink later) backs a new
`getCumulativeCoveredAreaKm2()`, which is now the number `3D_GAME_PROGRESS.md`'s World Coverage
section should read from — not `getCoveredAreaKm2()` (currently-resident area).

**Reasoning:** The previous approach to raising World Coverage — a bigger and bigger one-shot
`loadSquare` at boot (ADR-0002) — hits a hard ceiling around ~610 chunks (the triangle budget) and
leaves zero headroom for anything else once a real player/NPCs/water/castles exist. The
sustainable path is coverage that grows through *exploration*: as a moving reference point (camera
today, player from FAZ 4 on) crosses into unvisited territory, new chunks generate and count
permanently, while at any instant only a small, budget-safe neighborhood needs to be resident.
Implementing full eviction (unloading far chunks) right now was deliberately skipped: nothing yet
exercises exploration at a scale that would exceed the performance budget (a human dragging a dev
camera, not a full game with hours of play time), so building LRU/distance-based eviction today
would be complexity with no current failure it prevents — pure speculation about a future need.
`unloadChunk`/`disposeAll` already exist and are ready for a real eviction policy to call once
there's an actual reason to (either the resident chunk count approaches the desktop budget, or
FAZ 4 gives us a real player and a real memory-bound need). Verified this run with a headless-
browser pan simulation: panning the camera target ~7000m away from the boot-time preview's edge
streamed in new chunks exactly as expected, growing cumulative coverage from 42.25 km² to
54.75 km² with zero unload/reload thrashing anywhere near the original preview area.

**Alternatives considered:**
- *Build full load/unload (LRU or distance-based) streaming now.* Rejected for this sub-task:
  more moving parts (what evicts, when, how far past `radius` before eviction, whether an evicted
  chunk needs its terrain regenerated identically if revisited — it does, since generation is
  deterministic, but that's untested until eviction exists) for a problem this project doesn't
  have yet. Revisit the moment resident-chunk count threatens the budget.
- *Keep World Coverage tied to resident chunk count (`getCoveredAreaKm2`).* Rejected: the moment
  eviction is added, this number would silently start going backwards as old chunks unload even
  though the world has only ever grown — exactly the kind of stale/misleading metric this project's
  World Coverage tracking exists to prevent.

**Consequence:** `3D_GAME_PROGRESS.md`'s reported World Coverage baseline is the boot-time number
(currently 169 chunks / 42.25 km², from `loadSquare` — a static, reproducible figure any page load
produces). The cumulative number grows further at runtime as someone actually interacts with the
dev camera, which is real but session-specific and not something to hardcode as "the new total" —
future runs should note *that the mechanism works* (demonstrated) rather than chase a moving
runtime number. When real eviction is eventually added, it must keep incrementing
`everGenerated`/never decrementing it, or this ADR's whole point is lost.
