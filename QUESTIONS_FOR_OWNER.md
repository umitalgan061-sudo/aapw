# QUESTIONS_FOR_OWNER.md

Per `GOVERNANCE.md` §14: a real design/product decision logged here (with a temporary default)
instead of guessed at silently. Newest entry at the bottom.

- **(run 55, ADR-0075) What ground slope should count as "too steep to walk" for kingdom seats /
  future terrain features?** No code in this project enforces a walkable-slope limit yet
  (`physics.js`'s ground-height snap follows terrain regardless of steepness), so there was no
  existing project-defined value to reuse for `scripts/terrainSeatSafetyCheck.js`'s "gidilemez
  eğim" check. **Temporary default used:** 35° (stricter than Unity's default
  `CharacterController.slopeLimit`, 45°, and Unreal's default `WalkableFloorAngle`, ~44.7°). Revisit
  once real slope-based movement restriction (or a real playtest) exists to calibrate against.
