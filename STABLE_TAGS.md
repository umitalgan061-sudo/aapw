# STABLE_TAGS.md

Per `GOVERNANCE.md` §8.11: a one-line note each time a run passes the Session Quality Gate
and the game boots with zero console/page errors. Newest entry at the bottom.

- `stable-2026-07-31-0915` — run 56 end: terrain macro-relief (ADR-0075) + slope-aware road
  network (ADR-0076) landed, both with real headless-boot verification (zero console/page
  errors) and 14/14 smoke suite passing.
- `stable-2026-08-05-0400` — run 65 end: service-worker offline app-shell cache drift fixed
  (ADR-0083, 10 JS modules + 3 asset groups added to the precache list) + regression check added,
  17/17 smoke suite passing, zero console errors, real offline-mode reload verified. Local tag only
  — `git push origin <tag>` still rejected with `HTTP 403` (same known issue since run 58).
- `stable-2026-08-05-0454` — run 66 end: F2 debug panel PWA offline storage-quota monitoring
  (ADR-0084) landed, 17/17 smoke suite passing (assertions extended), zero console errors, real
  headless-Chromium screenshot proof. GOVERNANCE.md §15's PWA section now fully closed (cache-
  completeness run 65 + quota monitoring this run). Local tag only — `git push origin <tag>` still
  rejected with `HTTP 403` (same known issue since run 58).
- `stable-2026-08-05-0550` — run 66 end (3 sub-tasks): F2 storage-quota monitoring (ADR-0084),
  stale doc-comment fix, and FAZ 7 continuous chase (ADR-0085 — the dragon now leaves its castle to
  hunt the player, time-boxed at 18s). 18/18 smoke suite, zero console errors, two-angle visual +
  real-terrain trajectory evidence. Local tag only — `git push origin <tag>` still rejected with
  `HTTP 403` (same known issue since run 58).
